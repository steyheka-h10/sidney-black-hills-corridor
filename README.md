# Sidney-Black Hills Transportation Corridor Digital Archive

## Project Charter

This repository serves as a collaborative digital archive documenting the critical role of the Union Pacific Railroad and its supporting infrastructure (notably Clarke's Bridge) in the development of the Black Hills gold rush. The archive focuses on the economic and cultural impact of the railroad, drawing on primary sources related to the Sidney Chamber of Commerce and the Historical Land Mark Council's efforts.

## Research Questions

1. How did the Union Pacific Railroad, via the Sidney–Black Hills route, facilitate the transportation of people, goods, and capital during the gold rush era?
2. What was the economic rationale for constructing Clarke's Bridge, and how did it influence regional development?
3. How did the Sidney Chamber of Commerce promote and capitalize on the railroad's presence?
4. What records exist from the Historical Land Mark Council that highlight railroad‑related sites in the Black Hills?

- `/images/` – Historical photographs, diagrams, and maps (with appropriate attribution).

## Workflow

Research tasks are tracked as GitHub Issues, each tagged with relevant labels (`research`, `analysis`, `source‑needed`, etc.). Contributors work on feature branches and submit Pull Requests for peer review. Approved contributions are merged into `main` and summarized in the project Wiki.
